## Results 1.
There was no correlation between protein concentration from the BSA analysis and the results from the CS activity analysis (R=-0.13, p=0.29) which gives confidence that the BSA analysis is not skewing the results in favor of smaller or larger dry weights (supp fig 1).

## Results 2. 
There was no correlation between CS and triploid vs diploids 

## Results 3.
There was a difference between CS and multiple-stress vs single stress 

## Results 4. 
We observed differential mortality between triploids and diploids (77% vs 90%)
